# Proposal

The proposal of the OpenWIM Project is create a open environment to support WIM researchers to improve their research using open science concepts.

Open Science is built when 3 components is openly accessible:
* their publications (Open Access);
* their algorithms (Open Source), and;
* their data (Open Data).

To achieve these concepts is important to define the specifc objetives. Their are:
* Open standards to store and share data;
* Open standards to store and share code;
* A guideline to publish an open WIM research.

At the end, the OpenWIM repository can be used by other researchers to store their research in a centralized way.
