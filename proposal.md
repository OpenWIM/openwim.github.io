# Proposal

Proposal

The proposal of the OpenWIM Project is to create an open environment to support WIM researchers to improve their research using open science concepts.

Open Science is built when 3 components are openly accessible:

* their publications (Open Access);
* their algorithms (Open Source) and;
* their data (Open Data).

To achieve these concepts, it is important to define the specific objectives. They are:

* open standards to store and share data;
* open standards to store and share codes;
* a guideline to publish an open WIM research.

At the end, the OpenWIM repository can be used by other researchers to store their research in a centralized way.
