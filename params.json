They are:\r\n\r\n* open standards to store and share data;\r\n* open standards to store and share codes;\r\n* a guideline to publish an open WIM research.\r\n\r\nAt the end, the OpenWIM repository can be used by other researchers to store their research in a centralized way.\r\n\r\nWEB site: http://openwim.github.io\r\n\r\nIndex of works:\r\n\r\n|Title                                        | Status     |\r\n|:--------------------------------------------|:----------:|\r\n|[Open Science and Weigh in Motion Research](http://github.com/OpenWIM/Open-Science-and-Weigh-in-Motion-Research-Paper)    | in progress|\r\n|[PyWIM](http://github.com/OpenWIM/PyWIM)                                        | in progress|\r\n|[OpenWIM Data Standards](http://github.com/OpenWIM/openwim-standards/)                       | in progress|\r\n",
